/**
 * One-time migration off Electron `safeStorage` (issue #32). Desktop-only glue:
 * it supplies the crypto — the legacy file stored each secret as
 * `base64(safeStorage.encryptString(value))`, so here we base64-decode and
 * `safeStorage.decryptString` each value — while @maka/storage owns the
 * orchestration: the shared cross-process lock, the version gate, fail-closed
 * aborts, the atomic 0600 rewrite, and the tombstone. A successful run leaves
 * the file as shared v1 plaintext-0600, which the headless `FileCredentialStore`
 * then reads.
 *
 * Scope — this migrates EVERY secret in `credentials.json`, not just API keys:
 * bot tokens, bot app secrets, the proxy password, the gateway token, and the
 * Tavily key all decrypt to plaintext too. That is required, not incidental —
 * the desktop abandons `safeStorage` entirely (the live store is now the
 * pure-Node `FileCredentialStore`), so any value left encrypted would become
 * permanently unreadable. The accepted at-rest posture for all of them is
 * plaintext behind 0600 (SECURITY.md / file-first, #32).
 *
 * If `safeStorage` is unavailable the migration aborts and leaves the encrypted
 * file untouched (a later run migrates once it is available). main.ts runs this
 * before any credential use, non-fatally, in `whenReady`.
