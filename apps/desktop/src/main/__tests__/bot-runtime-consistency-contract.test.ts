/**
 * PR-BOT-RUNTIME-CONSISTENCY-CONTRACT-0
 *
 * A platform that lives in `BOT_LABELS[X].support === 'runtime'` is
 * making two co-dependent promises across two files:
 *
 *   1. `apps/desktop/src/renderer/settings/SettingsModal.tsx`
 *      `BOT_LABELS[X].support === 'runtime'`
 *   2. `packages/runtime/src/bots/bot-registry.ts`
 *      `isImplemented(X) === true`
 *
 * Runtime-labeled platforms must ALSO be listed in
 * `BOT_DELIVERY_PROVIDERS` (`packages/core/src/settings.ts`) so plan
 * reminders can target them. The reverse is NOT required: a platform
 * can be delivery-capable without being `'runtime'` — WeChat is a
 * delivery target via the optional local wechat-bridge, but its
 * end-to-end UX is gated on that external process so its `support`
 * stays `'credentials'`.
 *
 * Pin both lock-steps so a future PR that flips `support` (or adds
 * a new platform) cannot ship without keeping the locations in sync.
