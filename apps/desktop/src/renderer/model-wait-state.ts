/**
 * Pure model-wait derivation + rising-edge debounce for the two turn-wait cues
 * (#646).
 *
 * A turn has two kinds of "nothing is streaming right now" lulls, and they must
 * read differently:
 *   - `processing` — the connect-to-first-token wait at the turn head, before
 *     any event has arrived. The screen is otherwise empty, so it earns the
 *     prominent "正在处理…" indicator.
 *   - `continuing` — a mid-turn lull AFTER the turn has already produced content
 *     (a tool settled, a step's text finished) while the model works on the next
 *     step. The prior steps are already on screen, so this earns only a calm
 *     "继续中…" hint, never "正在处理…" (which would flicker on after every step
 *     and read as if the live thinking had been swallowed — the #646 regression
 *     this split fixes).
 *
 * The single dimension that separates them is the turn PHASE: `'waiting'` until
 * the first content event, `'streamed'` after. Kept free of React so the timing
 * is unit-tested with an injected scheduler (fake timers).
