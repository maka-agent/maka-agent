# patches

`scripts/apply-dependency-patches.mjs` applies these during the root `postinstall` with `--error-on-fail`, so a patch that stops applying blocks the install instead of vanishing. It skips when `patch-package` is unresolvable (`npm ci --workspace <name>`, `npm ci --omit=dev`); those trees are not what ships, and each section's guard test is what catches an unpatched one.

After bumping a patched dependency, re-run `npx patch-package <name>` so the filename tracks the installed version.

Every patch needs a reason and a deletion condition, and that is all this file carries — the derivation belongs in the guard test, and the measurements in the upstream issue.

Only `dist/` is ever patched: `package.json` `exports` resolves there and Maka compiles no vendored `src/`. The `.map` files are left stale, so a debugger inside patched code points at upstream `src/` lines that no longer describe what runs.

## `@ai-sdk/provider-utils`: a tool-call delta must agree with the call it continues

Fixes [#1967](https://github.com/maka-agent/maka-agent/issues/1967) and [#1976](https://github.com/maka-agent/maka-agent/issues/1976). `StreamingToolCallTracker` used `tool_calls[].index` — an association label a gateway may omit, repeat, or number freely — as storage slot, identity and ordering at once. 5.0.21 ([vercel/ai#18382](https://github.com/vercel/ai/pull/18382)) fixed the crash and promoted `id` to sole authority, which reproduces the defect with the fields swapped: gateways repeat `id` too, and `function.name` is still never consulted, so the Ollama shape — three calls at `index: 0`, no id, one repeating name — cannot be separated.

The patched tracker keys on nothing. Records live in creation order, each learning the aliases the wire uses for it; a delta resolves to the newest call one of its aliases claims and none contradicts; the emitted id is minted separately, because the wire's id space is not injective and three layers downstream assume ours is. The remaining behaviour and the shapes it cannot decide are stated as measured output in [vercel/ai#18440](https://github.com/vercel/ai/issues/18440) and pinned case by case in the guard — read those rather than re-deriving either here.

**Delete it when the guard holds without it.** Remove the patch, reinstall, run `packages/runtime/src/__tests__/model-factory-tool-call-index.test.ts`, and read the result by property rather than by count: `assertInputsSelfContained`, `assertToolCallIdsUsable`, `assertEventLifecycle`. Cases marked `Known boundary, deliberately locked in` assert that an undecidable shape fails loudly; an upstream that genuinely fixed the layers below would turn those red for a better implementation, so treat a red run there as a signal to re-read, not a verdict.

## `@astryxdesign/core`: "New messages" must clear at the bottom and on a fresh transcript

Fixes [#2205](https://github.com/maka-agent/maka-agent/issues/2205). `ChatLayout` never resets two pieces of per-conversation state: `hasNewMessages` clears only through the button's `dismiss()`, so scrolling back down leaves the label up; and a conversation switch reuses the transcript container, so the previous conversation's last message stays the baseline and the new one's first message reads as unread.

The patch clears the flag whenever the scroll lock re-engages, so "at bottom" owns the badge; adds a `conversationKey` prop that re-locks and resets the baseline when it changes; and exposes `reset()` on `useChatNewMessages`. A prop rather than a remount — remounting drops an in-progress composer draft, since Astryx's composer holds its content in internal state.

**Delete it when** Astryx clears the badge at the bottom and offers a baseline reset on a conversation switch without a remount. Repro: scroll up, receive a message, scroll back down; then switch conversations with the badge active — the new conversation must start clean and the composer draft must survive.

## `@astryxdesign/core`: `List` must render the accessible name its interface accepts

Fixes [#2189](https://github.com/maka-agent/maka-agent/issues/2189). `ListProps` extends `BaseProps`, which includes `aria-label`, but `List` destructures a fixed prop set and drops it, so six Maka lists pass localized names that disappear at runtime. The patch forwards `aria-label` to the root list — narrower than spreading the rest of `BaseProps` through a vendored component, and it leaves the `header` / `aria-labelledby` path alone.

**Delete it when `packages/ui/src/__tests__/astryx-list-accessible-name.test.tsx` passes without the patch.**

## `@astryxdesign/core`: a collapsed tool group must still say what it changed

A contiguous run of tool calls is one group, and a group collapses by default. The collapsed header projects the latest call's status icon, name and `target` alone — `additions`, `deletions`, `duration` and `stats` are all dropped — so the commonest shape, several edits in one turn, is the one that shows no counts. Nothing reaches that header from the product side; the `label` prop it accepts is destructured and never used.

The patch adds group-level `additions` / `deletions` and renders them beside the wrench count on the collapsed header. `ToolTrow` passes the run's total; the per-call counts stay on the rows inside.

**Delete it when `packages/ui/src/__tests__/tool-trow-stability.test.tsx` passes without the patch** — its grouped-diff case asserts the summed `+N` / `-N` on a collapsed run.

## `@astryxdesign/core`: a blank UA-CH platform must not decide "not Apple"

`Kbd`'s ⌘/Ctrl display and `useHotkeys`' `mod` binding share one platform
probe that prefers `navigator.userAgentData.platform` over the deprecated
`navigator.platform`. Electron bundles whose identity was rewritten after
copy (the ad-hoc-signed `Maka Dev.app` the TCC workflow builds) ship UA-CH
**empty** — `platform: ''`, `brands: []` — and the probe read the blank as
"not Apple": on macOS every `mod` hotkey listened for Ctrl (⌘+/ stopped
opening the keyboard help) and every keycap drew Ctrl. The patch treats a
blank `uaData.platform` as absent and falls through to `navigator.platform`;
a non-blank value keeps deciding exactly as before.

**Delete it when** the guard in `apps/desktop/e2e/keyboard-help.spec.ts`
(the "blank UA-CH" test, which fakes `platform: ''` + `MacIntel` via an init
script) passes without the patch — that means Astryx's own probe learned to
distrust the blank.

## `@astryxdesign/core`: an offered completion must live inside the editor it is offered in

Serves [#1874](https://github.com/maka-agent/maka-agent/pull/1874); upstreamed as [facebook/astryx#4822](https://github.com/facebook/astryx/issues/4822). Adds `inlineCompletion` / `inlineCompletionLabel` to `ChatComposerInput`: text offered as a continuation of the value, drawn dim after the caret and committed with Tab.

The prop exists because the alternative is worse in a way that is not a matter of taste. Drawn *outside* the editor — an absolutely positioned mirror of the draft — the preview and the insertion are two different layouts that agree only by luck: measured, a one-row field offering a 116-character completion showed 57 characters and Tab inserted all 116, so 59 characters entered the draft having never been on screen. Wrapping, growth, scrolling, the caret, the composition state and whether a trigger menu already owns Tab are all facts the editor holds and a sibling can only infer. Inside the editor there is nothing to infer and nothing to keep in sync: the offer is a `contenteditable=false` span in the real flow, skipped by `serialize` so it can never reach the value, and it wraps and scrolls because it is the same text in the same box. Accepting it is one ordinary `insertTextAtCursor` + `emitChange`.

The same ownership is what makes it announceable: the editor knows when an offer is actually on screen, so it can carry the polite live region — `inlineCompletionLabel` supplies the instruction, because "press Tab to accept" is product copy a component library has no business inventing.

**Delete it when** [facebook/astryx#4822](https://github.com/facebook/astryx/issues/4822) ships and `packages/ui/src/__tests__/astryx-inline-completion.test.tsx` passes against an unpatched package. Both cases fail loudly there: an upstream that does not know the prop lets it fall into `...rest` and React renders a stray `inlinecompletion` attribute on the root. The behaviour the seam exists for — Tab commits, Escape dismisses, nothing is offered that is not visible — needs a caret and a focused editor, so it is pinned by the `composer-inline-suggestion` play story in the Storybook smoke run instead.
