# Maka UI Quality Plan (one-month delivery contract)

This is the **UI-side delivery contract** complementing
`docs/full-product-test-plan.md` (full-product roadmap, @xuan's) and
@kenji's `notes/maka-one-month-completion-test-plan.md` (cross-cutting
test/release matrix). Where those define "what features ship and how the
overall test matrix is laid out", this document defines the UI-specific
quality bar each visible surface must clear before its PR can merge.

Treat the contracts here as merge gates. A UI PR that violates any §3
invariant or skips a §5 testing layer for its surface does not merge.

---

## 0 — Scope

**UI = everything inside `apps/desktop/src/renderer/` and
`packages/ui/`.** This covers:

- Visual composition (layout, tokens, light/dark/density themes)
- Interaction (mouse, keyboard, touch later)
- Motion (durations, easings, reduced-motion)
- Accessibility (ARIA, focus management, screen reader)
- UX text (labels, errors, empty states, copy stance)
- Visual smoke fixtures + screenshots
- Renderer-only IPC helpers (`window.maka.*`)

Out of scope (covered elsewhere):

- IPC handlers in `apps/desktop/src/main/**` (xuan + kenji own)
- Backend runtime + telemetry (xuan)
- Storage + migration (xuan)
- Cross-cutting release process (kenji)

---

## 1 — Per-surface gate (the "is this surface done?" checklist)

Every UI surface MUST clear **all** of these gates before merging:

| # | Gate | What it means | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Contract** | Surface listed in `docs/design-system.md` §9.x with state machine + boundary rules | `docs/design-system.md` |
| 2 | **Pure helper test** | All derived state extracted into pure function + node:test cases covering state transitions | `apps/desktop/src/renderer/*.ts` + `apps/desktop/src/main/__tests__/*.test.ts` |
| 3 | **Component contract** | Component declared in `packages/ui/src/components.tsx` with typed props; no untyped `any` props; no implicit DOM events leaking up | `packages/ui/src/components.tsx` |
| 4 | **Fixture scenario** | At least one `MAKA_VISUAL_SMOKE_FIXTURE=...` scenario seeds the surface with realistic data | `apps/desktop/src/main/visual-smoke-fixture.ts` |
| 5 | **Smoke path** | Step-by-step manual verification with explicit Pass / Fail signals | `apps/desktop/tests/smoke.md` |
| 6 | **Light + dark screenshots** | Both theme variants captured in the fixture | screenshots dir (TODO PR-IR-01) |
| 7 | **Narrow viewport screenshot** | ≤ 990 px width captured to verify mobile-ish layout | screenshots dir |
| 8 | **Failure / empty state** | If the surface has a failure or empty state, that's a separate fixture + screenshot | fixtures + screenshots |
| 9 | **a11y assertion** | ARIA roles, labels, keyboard navigation declared + tested per §3 | component + tests |
| 10 | **Motion contract** | Animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; durations from token catalog | `packages/ui/src/maka-tokens.css` + component CSS |
| 11 | **i18n contract** | Visible strings are Chinese by default; no English fallback in user-facing copy | component source |
| 12 | **Security contract** | No raw user input rendered back; no secret in any path; redactSecrets applied | component + tests |

Skipping any single gate is a release-no-go (see §11).

---

## 2 — UI testing layers (the "what kind of test" matrix)

Use **the minimum sufficient** testing layer for each concern. Over-testing
adds maintenance burden and slows merges.

| Concern | Layer | Tool | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pure derivation (badge tone, ordering, filtering) | node:test on pure helper | `node:test` | `deriveChatHeaderAlert` |
| CSS contract (no rule hides X, opacity restores on active) | grep-style assertion on styles.css | `fs.readFile + regex` | `stale-sessions.test.ts` |
| Component prop wiring (renderer → IPC → backend) | preload + ipc shape test | node:test on type | preload.ts shape check |
| User flow (rename, archive, send) | smoke.md manual path | manual | `smoke.md` Path 4 |
| Visual rendering (light/dark/narrow) | screenshot diff | TODO (PR-IR-01) | fixture screenshots |
| a11y semantics (ARIA, kbd) | smoke.md path with explicit Tab order assertion + AT spot check | manual | `smoke.md` Path 9-style |
| Motion (reduced-motion) | smoke.md path with system pref toggled | manual | dedicated path |
| Cross-platform (macOS / Win / Linux) | smoke.md per-platform run | manual | smoke.md preamble |
| Performance (cold start, scroll FPS) | smoke.md + dedicated metric | manual + future telemetry | smoke.md release section |

### What we do NOT test in the UI workspace

- React rendering via JSDOM (over-fragile; pure helper + smoke covers it)
- Backend logic (lives in @maka/runtime / @maka/storage workspaces)
- Network calls (mocked in pure helpers when needed; live calls live in
  @maka/runtime tests)

---

## 3 — Cross-surface invariants (always-on quality contract)

These are **non-negotiable** rules every UI PR must respect. They're the
same kind of "always-on" gate that linters enforce, except codified
prose because they're judgement calls.

### 3.1 Focus management

- Every modal MUST trap focus via `useModalA11y(ref, onEscape?)`.
- Every modal MUST restore focus to the previously-focused element on
  close.
- Focus ring MUST use `:focus-visible`, never bare `:focus`.
- All interactive elements MUST have `aria-label` if they have no visible
  text (icon-only buttons, etc.).

### 3.2 Keyboard

- All clickable controls MUST be reachable by Tab.
- All Tab stops MUST be in DOM order (no positive `tabIndex` except where
  documented in the design system).
- Roving tabindex pattern (Arrow keys) MUST be used for radio groups,
  toolbars, listboxes, menus — verified by node:test on the pure helper
  (see `model-table-keyboard.test.ts`).
- Cmd/Ctrl+K opens command palette (PR31). Esc closes it.
- ⌘/Ctrl+, opens Settings (PR98 menu).
- ⌘/Ctrl+F focuses session search (PR32).
- ? or ⌘/Ctrl+/ opens keyboard help (PR22).
- Enter sends message in composer; Shift+Enter newline (PR3).
- Esc cancels rename / dismisses modal / closes drawer.

### 3.3 Motion

- All durations use tokens from `--ease-out-strong / --ease-in-out-strong / --ease-drawer`.
- `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` caps every animation to ~0.01ms
  (already global cap; do not override).
- Use `@starting-style` for entrance animations where supported.
- Animate `transform` and `opacity` only; never `width / height / top`.

### 3.4 Density + theme

- Every component MUST render correctly under all three densities
  (`compact / comfortable / spacious`) — verified via density toggle in
  Settings.
- Every component MUST render correctly under light + dark theme via
  `.dark` class.
- Tokens MUST come from `maka-tokens.css`; **no hardcoded color** in
  component CSS (PR5 sweep; enforced by visual review).
- Theme picker preview tiles MUST mirror the actual chat surface (PR79).

### 3.5 Text + i18n

- All user-facing copy is **Chinese by default**.
- Errors go through `generalizedErrorMessage()` from `@maka/core` (PR58,
  PR74).
- UI-level `redactSecrets()` runs on any string that may contain user
  input or provider responses (PR60).
- **NEVER expose internal enums** ("演示版", "FakeBackend", reason codes,
  slugs) in user-visible labels. Put technical detail in tooltip.
- Empty / loading / error states are **first-class**; no surface ships
  with only a happy path.

### 3.6 Boundaries (renderer ↔ main)

- Renderer NEVER assembles absolute paths from a `relativePath`. (Artifact
  contract §9.1.5.)
- Renderer NEVER inspects `safeStorage` directly. Goes through
  `window.maka.connections.hasSecret(slug)`.
- Renderer NEVER opens a URL via `window.open(url)`. Goes through
  `shell.openExternal` in main via `setWindowOpenHandler` (PR96).
- Renderer NEVER drops a file into the DOM. `did-finish-load` blocks
  dragover/drop globally (PR96 follow-up).

### 3.7 Trust hierarchy (UI redactor + backend redactor)

- Backend `redactSecrets` from `@maka/core` is **authoritative**.
- UI `redactSecrets` is a **second layer** for runtime strings (tool
  output banner, copy-to-clipboard).
- Never display a raw error message from any IPC — always run through
  `cleanErrorMessage(error)` first.

## 5 — Required testing infra (PR-IR-XX series)

These are infrastructure PRs the UI side owes the rest of the project.
Without them, the gates in §1 can't be enforced uniformly.

### PR-IR-01 — Screenshot capture pipeline

**What.** A playwright (or Electron-native + tape-recorder) runner that
boots Maka under each `MAKA_VISUAL_SMOKE_FIXTURE=...` scenario, applies
light + dark + narrow viewport variants, and captures PNGs to
`apps/desktop/tests/screenshots/<scenario>/<variant>.png`.

**Why.** Right now `smoke.md` paths require a human to eyeball the
screen. Screenshots provide a regression baseline.

**Gate it unlocks.** L+D and Nar columns in §4 can flip from ⚙️ to ✅.

**Owner.** @yuejing (this is UI infra, not feature).

### PR-IR-02 — Screenshot diff CI gate

**What.** Compare new screenshots from PR branch vs `main` baselines.
Diff > N px or > X% area → CI fail. Reviewer can update baseline by
deleting the old PNG.

**Why.** Catch unintended visual regressions before merge.

**Owner.** @yuejing.

### PR-IR-03 — A11y assertion library

**What.** A small node:test helper that, given a fixture HTML snapshot,
verifies:
- Every `<button>` either has visible text or `aria-label`.
- Every modal has `role="dialog"` and `aria-labelledby` / `aria-label`.
- Every `<input>` / `<select>` has an associated `<label>` (via `for` or
  wrapping).
- No `tabIndex` > 0 in the snapshot.

**Why.** Today a11y is checked manually in smoke.md; this adds an
automated floor.

**Owner.** @yuejing.

### PR-IR-04 — Reduced-motion fixture variant

**What.** Add `MAKA_VISUAL_SMOKE_REDUCED_MOTION=1` env var that forces
`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` regardless of OS setting. Screenshot
pipeline (PR-IR-01) captures a `reduced-motion.png` variant per scenario.

**Why.** Verifies the motion contract per surface.

**Owner.** @yuejing.

### PR-IR-05 — i18n string extractor

**What.** Build-time script that walks `packages/ui` + `apps/desktop` for
all string literals in JSX text nodes and `aria-label` / `title`
attributes; flags any that contain only ASCII letters as "untranslated
English fallback".

**Why.** Locks down the "Chinese-default" contract.

**Owner.** @yuejing.

### PR-IR-06 — Strict component prop typing audit

**What.** ESLint rule (or tsc strict + grep) that bans `any` /
`Record<string, unknown>` / unsealed object types in component props.

**Why.** Component contracts must be enforced by the type system, not
docs.

**Owner.** @yuejing.

## 6 — UI PR template (every UI PR must answer)

```markdown
## Contract
- Surface: <name + design-system.md §9.x reference>
- State machine: <list states>
- Boundary: <renderer ↔ main contract this PR touches>

## User Flow
1. <step>
2. <step>
3. <observable signal>

## Tests
- [ ] Pure helper test added in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/<name>.ts` +
      `apps/desktop/src/main/__tests__/<name>.test.ts`
- [ ] CSS contract test if styles touched
- [ ] Fixture scenario seeded in `visual-smoke-fixture.ts`
- [ ] Smoke path added in `smoke.md` with Pass + Fail signals
- [ ] Light + dark + narrow screenshots captured (or noted as PR-IR-01
      blocker)
- [ ] a11y assertions: <list — ARIA roles, kbd nav, focus trap, screen
      reader label>

## Security
- [ ] No raw user input rendered back without `redactSecrets`
- [ ] No secret in any IPC path (uses `hasSecret` envelope when needed)
- [ ] No absolute path in renderer (uses `relativePath` + storage helper)
- [ ] No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` outside the artifact pane sandboxed
      iframe

## Not Included
- <explicit list of things out of scope this PR, link follow-ups>
```

If a UI PR doesn't answer all five sections, the PR doesn't merge.
Empty "Not Included" is fine; missing is not.

---

## 7 — Release no-go conditions (UI-specific)

A release is **blocked** if any of these is true at tag time:

### 7.1 Functional

- Any P0 user flow regressed (send / open settings / pick model / archive).
- Old sessions can block sending when a ready default exists (the P0 we
  just fixed; verify via smoke Path 12 + new chat from old session).
- "无法发送" / "已过期" banners appear with no actionable CTA.

### 7.2 Visual

- A surface ships with no light/dark or no narrow-viewport baseline.
- Screenshot diff CI red on main without an explicit baseline-update
  commit.
- Tokens drift detected (hardcoded color in component CSS).

### 7.3 Accessibility

- Any modal regresses focus trap or focus restoration.
- Any icon-only button without `aria-label`.
- Reduced-motion fixture variant shows animation > 0.1s.

### 7.4 Text / privacy

- Any user-facing string contains "fake" / "演示版" / internal enum reason
  codes.
- Any error toast contains raw user input or unredacted secret.
- Any tooltip / aria-label is English when the visible label is Chinese
  (mixed-language fallback is worse than fully-translated).

### 7.5 Boundary

- Any renderer-side absolute filesystem path.
- Any `window.open` outside the `setWindowOpenHandler` route.
- Any IPC channel returning `errno` / native errors without going through
  `generalizedErrorMessage`.

---

## 8 — Cross-platform gates

UI works on macOS by default (that's the primary dev box). Before any
release tag:

| Platform | Owner | Smoke run | Required passes |
|---|---|---|---|
| macOS arm64 | @yuejing | All 12 smoke paths | 12/12 |
| macOS x86_64 | TBD | First-run + send + permission | 3/3 |
| Windows | TBD | First-run + send + permission | 3/3 |
| Linux (Ubuntu LTS) | TBD | First-run + send + permission | 3/3 |

Cross-platform owners TBD — @WAWQAQ to assign when CI infrastructure is
ready.

---

## 9 — Performance gates

These are budget ceilings; we don't optimize past them without need.

| Metric | Budget | How measured |
|---|---|---|
| Cold start to first paint | < 1.5s on M1 air | manual stopwatch |
| Composer key-to-glyph latency | < 16ms (one frame) | manual eye check |
| Streaming text render | 60fps (no jank) | DevTools perf panel |
| Sidebar scroll with 200 sessions | 60fps | manual scroll test |
| Settings modal open | < 300ms (post @starting-style) | manual eye check |
| ⌘K palette open | < 100ms | manual eye check |

Regressions investigated, not blocked, unless the regression > 2x budget.

---

## 10 — Surface delivery checklist template

When picking up a pending surface (e.g. Health Center, Quick Chat), the
pattern is:

1. **Read** `docs/design-system.md` §9.x for the target surface.
2. **Write** pure derivation helper(s) under `apps/desktop/src/renderer/`
   with explicit input/output types. Locate by `<surface>.ts`.
3. **Write** node:test cases in `apps/desktop/src/main/__tests__/<surface>.test.ts`
   covering all state transitions + edge cases + invariants.
4. **Write** React component(s) under `packages/ui/src/components.tsx` (or
   a new file if surface is large enough). Wire the pure helper.
5. **Wire** the component into `apps/desktop/src/renderer/main.tsx` (or
   the matching App-level mount point). Pass IPC handles via
   `window.maka.*`.
6. **Add** styles to `apps/desktop/src/renderer/styles.css` using tokens
   only. Include light / dark / density / motion variants.
7. **Add** ARIA roles + keyboard navigation per §3.
8. **Add** fixture scenario in `visual-smoke-fixture.ts` with realistic
   data including the failure / empty state.
9. **Add** smoke path in `apps/desktop/tests/smoke.md` with Precondition /
   Steps / Pass signal / Fail signal.
10. **Capture** light + dark + narrow + reduced-motion screenshots once
    PR-IR-01 lands.
11. **Update** §4 matrix in this file to reflect the new ✅ row.
12. **PR description** fills the §6 template.

A surface typically needs 3–8 PRs (component scaffold → wire IPC →
states → keyboard → smoke + fixture). Avoid mega-PRs > 1000 LOC; split
along the checklist boundary.

## 12 — Open questions / pending decisions

- Cross-platform: who owns Win + Linux runs? Need a CI runner or a
  human on those machines.
- Screenshot diff tooling: playwright vs custom Electron runner? See
  PR-IR-01.
- Visual regression baselines: stored in repo (git LFS?) or external
  bucket?
- Accessibility testing: native AT (VoiceOver, NVDA, Orca) coverage —
  manual + cadence?
- Performance regression: do we instrument or just rely on manual?

These get filed as `notes/open-questions.md` after this doc lands and
get answered as the month-1 work progresses.

## 13 — How this doc evolves

- Each new surface adds a row to §4.
- Each new gate violation discovered in PR review adds a rule to §3.
- Each new infra need adds a PR-IR-XX row to §5.
- Release-no-go conditions grow when a regression makes it to main
  uncaught — that's a sign the corresponding gate was missing.

This doc is **a living contract**, not historical record. If a rule
becomes obsolete (a feature got cut, an invariant got automated away),
delete the rule and link to the commit that removed it.

Last updated: 2026-05-22 — initial publication after the P0 stale-session
wave (PR108e/g shipped, send-path rebind by @xuan landed).
