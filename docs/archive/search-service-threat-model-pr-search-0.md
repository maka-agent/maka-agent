# Search Service Threat Model

> Archived on 2026-07-13. This document records the PR-SEARCH-0/1.5 contract boundary, not the current search product implementation. Source and focused tests own the active contract.

PR-SEARCH-0 is a contract-only package. It must not add a real provider, browser engine, renderer network call, cache writer, or runtime search execution path.

PR-SEARCH-1.5 (this revision) adds the `SearchResultTarget` closed discriminated union (currently only `{ kind: 'thread'; sessionId: string; turnId?: string }`) so source-kind-specific navigation hints stay typed. Adding a new variant (memory / activity / etc.) is an explicit contract change. Thread navigation deliberately does NOT use `maka://session/<id>` — `packages/ui/src/maka-uri.ts:24` defers that scheme until a real session navigation contract exists. Renderers consume `SearchResult.target` for navigation; `SearchResult.url` stays reserved for `web` / `web_fetch` external results.

## Source Separation

Search is not one source. Maka must keep these sources typed and visibly separate:

- `thread`: local session/thread text search.
- `memory`: local or provider-backed semantic memory search.
- `activity`: future OCR/activity search, gated by Screen Recording and retention settings.
- `tool`: tool discovery, bounded by existing tool permission mode.
- `web`: external web search through an explicit provider.
- `web_fetch`: URL fetch/extraction, treated as active untrusted content.

Local private sources (`thread`, `memory`, `activity`) must not be silently mixed with external `web` results. UI and tool outputs should show source kind.

## Assets

- search query text;
- result titles, URLs, snippets, summaries, and markdown;
- cookies and browser session state;
- provider credentials and base URLs;
- chat history, memories, and future OCR/activity text;
- cache entries and embeddings;
- citation indexes injected into LLM context.

## Boundaries

1. Renderer to main: renderer can request search only through typed IPC.
2. Main to provider/site: query/result data may leave the machine.
3. Browser page to app: HTML/JS/CSS is untrusted active content.
4. Result to renderer: no raw HTML rendering.
5. Local private stores to LLM: memory/activity results may be prompt-injected only with explicit source semantics.
6. Cache/persistence: results and embeddings can become long-lived local data.

## Required Gates Before Web Search

- `normalizeSearchQuery`, `normalizeSearchLimit`, `normalizeSearchDomainList`, and `normalizeSearchUrl` before provider calls.
- URL scheme allowlist: only `http:` and `https:`.
- Redirect/private-network policy before URL fetch.
- Domain allow/block suffix matching; blocked wins.
- Result and total-output byte caps.
- AbortSignal and wall-clock timeout.
- No query/snippet/markdown bodies in telemetry.
- Cache policy with TTL, refresh bypass, and no authenticated page caching by default.
- Browser mode must use isolated partitions by default; no defaultSession cookie reuse.
- CAPTCHA/challenge returns `needs_human_browser`, not indefinite hidden-browser waiting.

## What Not To Copy From reference implementation

- Hidden Google scraping as the default Search Service.
- `defaultSession` browser/cookie reuse.
- Cookie sync from debug windows into search/fetch sessions.
- Cookie import/export without typed payload, user action, and audit log.
- Raw HTML rendering in the app.
- One untyped result list that mixes local thread/memory/activity and external web.

## Minimum Test Matrix

- query trim, empty reject, type reject, length cap;
- limit default/clamp/reject;
- domain canonicalization, dedupe, suffix matching;
- URL scheme allowlist and tracking parameter stripping;
- freshness rewrite for latest/today/now/今天/最新 queries;
- no rewrite for historical/archive/since/过去 queries;
- citation indexes monotonic once execution exists;
- timeout/abort returns structured error once execution exists;
- renderer has no direct network primitive for search once IPC exists;
- telemetry omits snippets and markdown bodies once execution exists.
