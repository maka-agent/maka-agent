/**
 * Render-layer fold for the collapsed "Processing" block (#1307).
 *
 * The turn timeline model (`TurnTimelineItem`) stays FLAT — every
 * timeline-rewriting pass (overlayLiveTurn, projectTurnTools, shell-run
 * folding) operates on the raw thinking/text/tools sequence and never has to
 * maintain a nesting invariant. This module derives the folded view right
 * before rendering:
 *
 *  - answer `text` entries stay in place and are the only grouping boundary;
 *  - a maximal thinking+tools run between two texts folds into ONE
 *    `processing` block when it contains at least one tools group, preserving
 *    the run's interleaved order as `children`;
 *  - a pure-thinking run stays bare (the 深度思考 disclosure renders it
 *    directly — wrapping a lone reasoning block would just double the fold).
 *
 * Each block carries a stable `id` derived from the PRECEDING answer text's
 * messageId (`'start'` when the block opens the turn). Between two texts there
 * is at most one block, so the id is unique per turn — and, unlike a key
 * guessed from the first child, it survives the first tool being projected
 * away (shell-run folding) without remounting the disclosure or dropping a
 * manual open/close. When projection removes a block's LAST tools group the
 * block itself dissolves (the remaining run is pure thinking), so the bare
 * 深度思考 entries remount and any manual open state inside is reset — the
 * accepted cost of deriving block existence at render time instead of
 * representing a tools-less block in the model.
