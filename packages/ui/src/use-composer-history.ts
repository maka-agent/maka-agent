/**
 * Composer prompt-history navigation hook (issue #1044).
 *
 * Owns the up/down-arrow recall state that used to live inline in
 * `composer.tsx`: the in-memory mirror of the global input history plus the
 * "mid-navigation" index/savedDraft pair. The pure state machine
 * (`navigateComposerHistory`, `reconcileHistorySync`,
 * `rememberComposerHistoryEntry`) stays in `composer-helpers.ts` and the
 * localStorage seam in `input-history.ts` — both unit-tested there. This hook
 * is the React seam that applies navigation results through the input's
 * `ComposerTextPort`.
 *
 * `ChatComposerInput` ships its own arrow-key recall, but that history is
 * in-memory per mount, unconditional on the draft, and has no deletion story.
 * Ours is persisted across reloads, shared with every other input surface,
 * clearable from Settings · 数据, and refuses to hijack the caret inside a
 * multi-line draft — so the composer mounts the input with `hasHistory={false}`
 * and keeps this.
