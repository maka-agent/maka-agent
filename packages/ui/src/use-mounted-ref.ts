/* PR-SIMPLIFY-ROUND-D-0: the fail-soft settings surfaces each hand-rolled
   the same mounted guard (a ref set true on mount, false on unmount, read
   before every post-await setState/toast). One shared hook replaces the
   boilerplate; components that must also reset their own refs on unmount
   keep a separate cleanup effect for those.

   Starts true (not false) so reads during the first render — before
   effects run — already report "mounted"; the effect re-arms it for
   StrictMode's mount → unmount → remount double-invoke. Not for
   lifecycle-scoped guards (use-workspace-instructions-controller owns a
   variant conditioned on a lifecycle counter — that one is not
   boilerplate and stays local). */
